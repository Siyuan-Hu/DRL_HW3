Overview

This code provides implementation of multiple deep reinforcement learning algorithms on LunarLander-v2 environment.
The implementations are based on Tensorflow and Keras. I use OpenAI Gym as the RL environment.

imitation.py:

	content:
		The implementation of behavior cloning using supervised imitation learning from an expert policy
	note:
		You will need LunarLander-v2-config.json and LunarLander-v2-weights.h5 to load the expert model.

reinforce.py:

	content:
		The implementation of REINFORCE
	note:
		You will need LunarLander-v2-config.json to load the network config.

a2c.py:

	content:
		The implementation of N-step Advantage Actor Critic

	note:
		You will need LunarLander-v2-config.json to load the actor network config.
		Our implementation can solve this environment for different N_step(1, 20, 50, 100).
		You can change the N_step parameter to see the difference.

plot.py:

The auxiliary script to parse the log and plot the performance.
You can run the script to generate the performance plot.
You will need to run the above implementation code to generate the log file first.

LunarLander-v2-config.json:

The policy network architecture.

LunarLander-v2-weights.h5:

The expert model's weights.
